# LiFFT
The little FFT library.

A simple FFT and DCT2 library in a header only format that makes it easy to drop into a project. Performance isn't the main concern, but it still is about half the speed of FFTPACK. If you need raw performance, use [FFTPACK](https://www.netlib.org/fftpack/) or [FFTW](https://fftw.org/).
