# 🎛️ LiFFT
The little FFT library.

A simple FFT and DCT (II/III/IV) library in a header only format that makes it easy to drop into a project and use. Measuring in at ~150 sloc for the FFT functions, and another ~70 for DCTs it's main goal is just to be small. Even though performance isn't the main concern, it's reasonably comparable to [FFTPACK](https://www.netlib.org/fftpack/) or [FFTW](https://fftw.org/).
